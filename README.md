Hello Moslem and Malek thank you for helping me with this 
heres what i need help with which is the sling shot we talked about in the meeting

Miqla (Slingshot Attack Mechanic)

Description:
The Miqla is a ranged attack the player uses to hit flying enemies or distant ground targets.
Unlike the sword (used only for close combat on the ground), the Miqla lets the player aim and launch a projectile by swiping on the screen.

How it works:

The player swipes up or down to set the trajectory and power of the shot.

Dragging downward increases power and changes the angle.

When the player releases, the character fires the Miqla projectile toward the aimed direction.

The projectile can hit enemies in the air or far on the ground, depending on how the player aimed.

There will be a slow-mo phase each time the player uses it

Example:

A flying enemy hovers above.
The player drags down to charge the Miqla, then releases â€” the shot arcs upward and strikes the target midair.
For ground enemies far away, the same mechanic can be used to hit them at a lower angle.

For example when i thought of this i was thinking of angrybirds when you shot the birds into the buildings or pigs but 3d style i want there to be like a short slow-mo phase
each time the player uses it so it can be smoother
