    RUSH WRATH - ENVIRONMENT OBSTACLE MANUAL PLACEMENT GUIDE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

📋 GAME OVERVIEW
----------------
Phase 1 (FORWARD): Run from Z=0 to Z=200, memorize obstacle positions
Phase 2 (REVERSE): Run back Z=200 to Z=0, dodge obstacles from memory + fight enemies

3-Lane System:
  LEFT   = X: -3 (Lane -1)
  MIDDLE = X:  0 (Lane 0)
  RIGHT  = X:  3 (Lane 1)


🎯 YOUR OBSTACLE TYPES
----------------------

1. CACTUS - Single Lane
   └─ Place at X: -3, 0, or 3
   └─ Takes 1 lane
   └─ Instant Death: YES

2. BIG BOULDER - Two Adjacent Lanes
   └─ Place at X: -1.5 (blocks Left+Middle)
   └─ OR X: 1.5 (blocks Middle+Right)
   └─ Takes 2 side-by-side lanes
   └─ Instant Death: YES

3. N-SHAPED ROCK - Two Opposite Lanes
   └─ Place at X: 0 (centered)
   └─ Blocks Left+Right lanes (player goes through middle)
   └─ Takes 2 opposite lanes
   └─ Instant Death: YES

4. TREE - All Three Lanes
   └─ Place at X: 0 (centered)
   └─ Blocks all lanes - MUST JUMP
   └─ Takes all 3 lanes
   └─ Instant Death: YES


🛠️ SETUP STEPS (Do Once Per Obstacle Type)
-------------------------------------------

1. EXTRACT MESH FROM FBX
   - In Project window, expand /Assets/Enviroment/enviroment.fbx
   - Find your obstacle mesh (Cactus, Boulder, NRock, Tree)
   - Drag into Hierarchy temporarily

2. ADD OBSTACLE SCRIPT
   - Select the GameObject
   - Add Component → "EnvironmentObstacle"
   - Check "Is Instant Death" = TRUE
   - Damage Amount = 1 (ignored when instant death is on)

3. ADD COLLIDER
   - Add Component → Box Collider (or Mesh Collider)
   - Adjust size to fit obstacle tightly
   - Leave "Is Trigger" UNCHECKED (solid collision)

4. SET TAG
   - Top of Inspector → Tag → "Obstacle"

5. CREATE PREFAB
   - Drag GameObject from Hierarchy → /Assets/Prefabs/
   - Name it: Cactus, BigBoulder, NRock, or Tree
   - Delete from Hierarchy (prefab saved)

6. REPEAT for all 4 obstacle types


📍 PLACING OBSTACLES IN SCENE
------------------------------

Your scene already has /Obstacles parent with 10 obstacles.
Add your environment obstacles the same way:

1. Drag prefab from /Assets/Prefabs/ into scene
2. Parent it under "/Obstacles" GameObject
3. Position manually:
   - X position based on lane configuration (see above)
   - Y position: 0.5 to 1.0 (on ground)
   - Z position: anywhere from 10 to 190 (before goal at 200)

4. Rename for clarity: "Obstacle_11_Cactus", "Obstacle_12_Tree", etc.

EXAMPLE PLACEMENTS:
  Cactus at Z=25, Left Lane:     X=-3, Y=0.5, Z=25
  Boulder at Z=50, Blocks L+M:   X=-1.5, Y=0.5, Z=50
  NRock at Z=75, Blocks L+R:     X=0, Y=0.5, Z=75
  Tree at Z=100, Blocks All:     X=0, Y=1, Z=100


💡 PLACEMENT TIPS
-----------------

✓ Spread obstacles from Z=10 to Z=190
✓ Vary lane positions for interesting patterns
✓ Use Trees sparingly - they force jumps
✓ Place obstacles at least 5-10 units apart
✓ Test both forward AND reverse phases
✓ Remember: Player memorizes in Phase 1, dodges in Phase 2


🔧 TESTING
----------

1. Enter Play Mode
2. Phase 1: Run forward, note obstacle positions
3. Reach Goal at Z=200
4. Phase 2: Run back, try to avoid obstacles
5. Collision = Instant Death → Game Over
6. Check Console for "Player hit [name] - Instant Death!"


⚠️ TROUBLESHOOTING
-------------------

Obstacle doesn't kill player:
  → Check "Obstacle" tag is set
  → Check EnvironmentObstacle script attached
  → Check "Is Instant Death" enabled
  → Check collider exists and isn't trigger

Player passes through obstacle:
  → Check collider size covers the mesh
  → Player has Rigidbody (should already have)
  → Collider is NOT set to "Is Trigger"

Obstacle looks wrong:
  → Create materials in /Assets/Materials/
  → Assign to MeshRenderer on obstacle
  → Check lighting in scene

Wrong position:
  → Use Scene view gizmos for reference
  → Lane positions: -3, 0, 3
  → Multi-lane obstacles should be centered


📂 FILE LOCATIONS
------------------

Script:
  /Assets/Scripts/EnvironmentObstacle.cs

Models:
  /Assets/Enviroment/enviroment.fbx

Prefabs (you create):
  /Assets/Prefabs/Cactus.prefab
  /Assets/Prefabs/BigBoulder.prefab
  /Assets/Prefabs/NRock.prefab
  /Assets/Prefabs/Tree.prefab

Scene Structure:
  /Obstacles
    /Obstacle_01 through _10 (existing)
    /Obstacle_11_Cactus (yours)
    /Obstacle_12_Tree (yours)
    ... etc


✨ QUICK REFERENCE
------------------

Lane X Positions:
  Left:   -3
  Middle:  0
  Right:   3

Multi-Lane Centers:
  Left+Middle:    -1.5
  Middle+Right:    1.5
  Left+Right:      0 (centered)
  All Three:       0 (centered)

Level Bounds:
  Start: Z = 0
  Goal:  Z = 200
  Safe obstacle range: Z = 10 to 190


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Everything is set up for MANUAL PLACEMENT. Just create prefabs
and drag them into /Obstacles parent at your desired positions!
