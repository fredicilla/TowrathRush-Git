    RUSH WRATH - INTRO CINEMATIC SETUP GUIDE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🎬 CINEMATIC SEQUENCE
---------------------
ONE SMOOTH CONTINUOUS SHOT with SLIGHT ARC:

PLAYS ONLY ONCE (first time you start the game):

1. Camera starts BEHIND tent, low to ground (cinematic angle)
2. Camera SMOOTHLY rises in a gentle arc while moving forward
3. Camera reveals the level ahead with dramatic perspective
4. Camera settles at moderate height overlooking the path
5. Player runs out of tent
6. Camera transitions to follow player and gameplay starts

IF PLAYER DIES & RESTARTS:
- Cinematic is SKIPPED
- Game starts immediately at tent with camera following
- Player can move right away

CAMERA STYLE: Smooth crane shot with slight upward arc
FEEL: Like a movie opening - dramatic but not too high!


🛠️ SETUP STEPS
---------------

STEP 1: CREATE CINEMATIC CONTROLLER
------------------------------------
1. In Hierarchy, create Empty GameObject (Right-click → Create Empty)
2. Rename it to "IntroCinematic"
3. In Inspector, click "Add Component"
4. Type: "IntroCinematic"
5. Press Enter


STEP 2: CONFIGURE REFERENCES (Auto-filled, but verify)
-------------------------------------------------------
The script will auto-find these, but you can manually assign:

- Main Camera: Drag "/Main Camera" from Hierarchy
- Tent: Drag "/TENT" from Hierarchy  
- Player: Drag "/Player" from Hierarchy


STEP 3: ADJUST CAMERA POSITIONS (Optional)
-------------------------------------------
NEW IMPROVED SETTINGS for cinematic feel:

Start Camera Offset (behind tent, LOW):
  X: 0      (centered behind tent)
  Y: 1.5    (LOW - near ground level, dramatic!)
  Z: -6     (closer to tent)

End Camera Offset (forward, MODERATE height):
  X: 0      (still centered)
  Y: 8      (moderate elevation - NOT too high!)
  Z: 40     (forward down the track)

BONUS: Camera has automatic UPWARD ARC during movement
       (adds +2 units at peak for smooth rising motion)


STEP 4: ADJUST TIMING (Optional)
---------------------------------
Control how long the shot lasts:

- Cinematic Duration: 12 seconds (entire smooth camera movement)
- Delay Before Player Runs: 1 second (pause after camera stops)

TOTAL CINEMATIC TIME: ~15 seconds before gameplay starts

The camera moves CONTINUOUSLY for the entire duration!


STEP 5: PLAYER START POSITION (Optional)
-----------------------------------------
Where player starts/ends relative to tent:

Player Start Position Offset:
  X: 0
  Y: 0
  Z: -3   (inside/behind tent)

Player End Position Offset:
  X: 0
  Y: 0
  Z: 3    (in front of tent)

Player Run Speed: 8 (how fast player runs out)


STEP 6: POSITION YOUR TENT
---------------------------
1. Select "/TENT" in Hierarchy
2. Set Position in Inspector:
   X: 0    (centered in middle lane)
   Y: 0    (on ground)
   Z: -5   (behind starting point)

This puts the tent at the start of your level!


STEP 7: TEST THE CINEMATIC
---------------------------
FIRST TIME PLAYING:
1. Press Play
2. Full cinematic plays automatically (~15 seconds):
   
   00:00 - Camera behind tent, low angle
   00:00-12 - Camera SMOOTHLY rises and moves forward
   00:12 - Camera reaches elevated forward position
   00:13 - Player runs out of tent!
   00:15 - Camera follows, gameplay starts!

AFTER RESTARTING (Player dies):
1. Press Play
2. Cinematic SKIPPED - instant gameplay!
3. Player at tent, ready to move immediately

CAMERA MOVEMENT: Continuous smooth motion (no stops!)

TO SEE CINEMATIC AGAIN:
- Unity Menu → Edit → Clear All PlayerPrefs
- OR uncheck "Skip On Restart" in IntroCinematic component


🎮 HOW IT WORKS
---------------

START:
- Player controls disabled
- GameManager.isGameActive = false
- CameraFollow disabled
- Camera takes manual control

DURING:
- Camera animates through positions
- Player animated running out of tent

END:
- Player controls enabled
- GameManager.isGameActive = true
- CameraFollow enabled
- IntroCinematic deletes itself
- Normal gameplay begins!


⚙️ ADVANCED CUSTOMIZATION
--------------------------

MAKE IT LONGER:
- Increase "Cinematic Duration" (try 15-20 seconds)

MAKE IT FASTER:
- Decrease "Cinematic Duration" (try 8-10 seconds)

CHANGE CAMERA START:
- Adjust "Start Camera Offset"
- Lower Y = closer to ground
- More negative Z = further behind tent

CHANGE CAMERA END:
- Adjust "End Camera Offset"
- Higher Y = more elevated view (but keep under 20 for cinematic feel)
- Higher Z = further forward down the track

MAKE IT MORE DRAMATIC:
- Start with Y=1 (very low, ground level)
- End with Y=15, Z=80 (high, far forward)

SKIP CINEMATIC (For Testing):
- Disable the "IntroCinematic" GameObject in Hierarchy


🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING
------------------

Camera doesn't move:
→ Make sure CameraFollow is enabled in scene
→ Check that Main Camera is assigned

Player doesn't run out:
→ Check TENT position is set correctly
→ Verify Player is assigned in script

Cinematic plays every time:
→ This is normal! It plays on scene start
→ To skip: disable IntroCinematic GameObject

Controls don't work after cinematic:
→ Check Console for "Intro cinematic finished" message
→ Make sure GameManager exists in scene

✨ TIPS
-------
✓ Test in Play Mode to preview the cinematic
✓ Adjust timing to match your game's pacing
✓ Position obstacles to look good in top-down shot
✓ You can add music/sound effects later
✓ Consider fading in from black for polish
