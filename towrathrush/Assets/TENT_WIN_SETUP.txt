    TENT WIN TRIGGER SETUP - Return Home to Victory!
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🎯 GOAL: Player wins when reaching tent during REVERSE phase

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

📋 SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
---------------------

OPTION 1: Add Trigger to Existing Tent
---------------------------------------

1. Select /TENT in Hierarchy

2. Add Component → Box Collider
   - Check "Is Trigger" ✓
   - Size: Set large enough to detect player
     X: 10
     Y: 10
     Z: 10
   - Center: Adjust if needed

3. Add Component → Tent Win Trigger
   - Script will automatically detect reverse phase
   - Visual color: Yellow (shows in Scene view)

4. Done! Test by playing through to reverse phase


OPTION 2: Create Separate Win Zone GameObject
----------------------------------------------

1. Right-click in Hierarchy → Create Empty
   - Name it "TentWinZone"

2. Position it at the tent:
   - Transform Position:
     X: 0
     Y: 2
     Z: -136 (same as tent)

3. Add Component → Box Collider
   - Check "Is Trigger" ✓
   - Size: 
     X: 10
     Y: 10
     Z: 10

4. Add Component → Tent Win Trigger

5. Done!

⚙️ HOW IT WORKS
---------------

PHASE 1: FORWARD
Player starts at tent (Z=-136)
→ Player runs forward to goal (Z=200)
→ Player reaches goal trigger
→ Switches to REVERSE PHASE

PHASE 2: REVERSE
Player at goal (Z=200)
→ Player runs BACKWARD to tent (Z=-136)
→ Player enters tent trigger zone
→ TentWinTrigger checks: Is Reverse Phase? YES!
→ Calls GameManager.LevelComplete()
→ 🎉 VICTORY! 🎉


PHASE 1 (Forward):
Player at tent → Nothing happens (not reverse yet)

PHASE 2 (Reverse):
Player at tent → WIN! Level Complete!


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🛠️ WHAT WAS CHANGED
--------------------

NEW FILES:
- TentWinTrigger.cs (detects player return in reverse phase)

UPDATED FILES:
- PhaseManager.cs
  * startPosition: Z=0 → Z=-136 (matches tent location)
  * Win threshold: 5 units → 10 units (more forgiving)

EXISTING SYSTEM:
- PhaseManager already had LevelComplete() check
- Just needed correct Z position and tent trigger


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

✅ VERIFICATION
---------------

1. Press Play
2. Wait for cinematic to finish
3. Run forward to goal (Z=200)
4. Watch phase switch to REVERSE
5. Run BACKWARD to tent (Z=-136)
6. When you reach tent → LEVEL COMPLETE!

Console should show:
"Player reached the tent during reverse phase - LEVEL COMPLETE!"
"LEVEL COMPLETE! You made it back to the start!"
"Level Complete! Final Score: [your score]"

🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING
------------------

ISSUE: Player reaches tent but doesn't win

FIX:
1. Check TENT or TentWinZone has Box Collider
2. Make sure "Is Trigger" is CHECKED
3. Make sure TentWinTrigger script is attached
4. Check console - should see "Player at tent but not in reverse phase yet..."
   (This means trigger works, but you're not in reverse phase)


ISSUE: Win happens too early/late

FIX:
1. Adjust Box Collider SIZE on tent trigger
2. Bigger size = win earlier
3. Smaller size = win later (must get closer)


ISSUE: Nothing happens at all

FIX:
1. Make sure Player has tag "Player"
2. Check PhaseManager exists in scene
3. Check GameManager exists in scene
4. Look at console for error messages


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

💡 CUSTOMIZATION
----------------

Change Trigger Size:
- Select tent/TentWinZone
- Box Collider → Size
- Bigger = easier to win (detect from far)
- Smaller = harder to win (must get close)

Change Win Message:
- Open TentWinTrigger.cs
- Edit line 13: "LEVEL COMPLETE!"

Add Visual Effect:
- Attach particle system to tent
- Trigger particles when player returns

📊 CURRENT SETUP SUMMARY
-------------------------

Tent Position:     Z = -136
Goal Position:     Z = 200
Level Length:      336 units

Player Journey:
  START:  Tent (-136)
  FORWARD: → Goal (200)  [336 units]
  REVERSE: ← Tent (-136) [336 units]
  TOTAL:   672 units of gameplay!

Win Condition:
  Player.Z <= -126 (within 10 units of tent at -136)
  AND currently in Reverse Phase
  = VICTORY!


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🎉 READY TO TEST!
-----------------

Add the Box Collider + TentWinTrigger to your TENT GameObject
and test the full level loop!
