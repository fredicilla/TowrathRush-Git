    CINEMATIC SKIP SYSTEM - Better UX for Restarts
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🎯 GOAL: Show cinematic ONCE, then skip on restarts

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🎬 HOW IT WORKS
---------------

FIRST GAME LAUNCH:
✓ Full 12-second cinematic plays
✓ Player sees the level introduction
✓ Dramatic camera crane shot
✓ Player frozen until cinematic ends
✓ System remembers: "Cinematic has been played"

RESTART AFTER DEATH/LOSS:
✓ Cinematic automatically SKIPPED
✓ Player starts at tent immediately
✓ Camera already in follow position
✓ Gameplay starts right away (0.5 sec fade-in)
✓ No waiting - instant action!

RESULT: Better player experience!
- First time: Epic intro
- Restarts: Quick jump back in


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

⚙️ TECHNICAL DETAILS
--------------------

System uses PlayerPrefs to remember state:
- Key: "IntroCinematicPlayed"
- Value: 0 = Not played, 1 = Already played

On Start():
  IF cinematic already played AND skipOnRestart = true:
    → SkipToGameplay()
  ELSE:
    → PlayIntroCinematic()

SkipToGameplay():
  1. Position player at tent
  2. Position camera in follow position
  3. Enable player control immediately
  4. Enable camera follow
  5. Start gameplay (0.5s transition)

PlayIntroCinematic():
  1. Full 12-second crane shot
  2. Player animation out of tent
  3. Camera transition to follow
  4. Mark as played in PlayerPrefs

🎮 PLAYER EXPERIENCE
--------------------

SCENARIO 1: Brand New Player
-----------------------------
1. Launch game for first time
2. "Playing intro cinematic for the first time" (console)
3. Watch full cinematic
4. Play level

SCENARIO 2: Player Dies
------------------------
1. Player hits obstacle → Game Over
2. Click Restart button
3. "Cinematic already played - skipping directly to gameplay"
4. Instant start at tent (no 12-second wait!)
5. Player can move immediately

SCENARIO 3: Multiple Deaths
----------------------------
Every restart after the first:
→ Instant gameplay start
→ No cinematic

Player only sees cinematic ONCE per game session!


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🔧 CONTROLS & TESTING
---------------------

INSPECTOR SETTING:
------------------
IntroCinematic GameObject → IntroCinematic component:

☑ Skip On Restart (default: checked)
  - Checked: Cinematic plays once, then skips
  - Unchecked: Cinematic ALWAYS plays (testing mode)


RESET FOR TESTING:
------------------
Want to see the cinematic again?

METHOD 1: Clear PlayerPrefs (Full Reset)
1. Unity Menu → Edit → Clear All PlayerPrefs
2. Stop Play mode if running
3. Press Play → Cinematic plays again!

METHOD 2: Console Command
1. Open Console window
2. Type and enter:
   IntroCinematic.ResetCinematicFlag();
3. Press Play → Cinematic plays again!

METHOD 3: Uncheck Skip On Restart
1. Select IntroCinematic in Hierarchy
2. Inspector → Uncheck "Skip On Restart"
3. Cinematic now plays EVERY time
4. Good for testing camera angles!

GAME START
    ↓
Has "IntroCinematicPlayed" flag?
    ↓
  NO ────────────────────→ YES
    ↓                        ↓
Play Full Cinematic      Skip To Gameplay
    ↓                        ↓

    └────→ GAMEPLAY ←────────┘


RESTART (Game Over)
    ↓
Load Scene Again
    ↓
Has "IntroCinematicPlayed" flag?
    ↓
  YES (from before!)
    ↓
Skip To Gameplay
    ↓
INSTANT ACTION!


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

💡 CUSTOMIZATION
----------------

Change Skip Behavior:
- Select IntroCinematic in Hierarchy
- Toggle "Skip On Restart" checkbox
  ☑ = Skip after first play (default)
  ☐ = Always play cinematic

Change Instant Start Delay:
- Open IntroCinematic.cs
- Find SkipToGameplay() coroutine
- Change: yield return new WaitForSeconds(0.5f);
  → Higher = longer fade-in
  → Lower = faster start
  → 0 = instant (no delay)

Add Custom Logic:
- Hook into HasCinematicBeenPlayed()
- Check if player completed tutorial
- Check if it's a new level
- Custom conditions for when to play cinematic

🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING
------------------

ISSUE: Cinematic plays every time even after restart

FIX:
1. Check IntroCinematic component
2. Make sure "Skip On Restart" is CHECKED
3. If unchecked, check it
4. Test again


ISSUE: Cinematic never plays at all

FIX:
1. Clear PlayerPrefs: Edit → Clear All PlayerPrefs
2. Check console for "Cinematic already played" message
3. If yes, the flag was set - clearing fixes it


ISSUE: Instant start is TOO instant (jarring)

FIX:
1. Open IntroCinematic.cs
2. Find: yield return new WaitForSeconds(0.5f);
3. Change to: yield return new WaitForSeconds(1.5f);
4. Gives players more time to see the tent before moving


ISSUE: Want to test cinematic but it keeps skipping

FIX:
1. Uncheck "Skip On Restart" in Inspector
2. OR use Edit → Clear All PlayerPrefs before each test
3. Remember to re-check "Skip On Restart" when done!
